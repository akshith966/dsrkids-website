    <div class="mont"><img src="mont.jpg"></div>
    <div class="mont"><p>At Sri Dsr Kids Playschool, we follow the Montessori method to encourage independence, creativity, and a lifelong love for learning. Children explore at their own pace using specially designed materials that build confidence and curiosity. Our classrooms are calm, child-centered environments where teachers guide rather than instruct, allowing kids to discover through hands-on experience. This method nurtures not only academic growth but also social and emotional development, laying a strong foundation for each child’s future success</p></div>

These celebrations promote unity, respect for diversity, and excitement among the little ones. Parents are often invited to join the festivities, making it a truly joyful and inclusive experience for all.</p></div>
